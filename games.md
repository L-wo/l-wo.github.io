In lockdown, I learned JS by following a course on [Codecademy] which used the Phaser.js framework to teach the fundamentals of Javescript. My final project was this game - a simple speed puzzle based on the fun task of hanging a truss full of lights based on a lighting plan - something which I might not get to do for a while!

The original version was a bit more full-featured - with a high score logging back-end. I will write a blog post about that soon and link to that [here](I haven't done it yet). The fastest time on record was about 2:21 by "Jadyn" - I personally couldn't get it under 3 minutes!
