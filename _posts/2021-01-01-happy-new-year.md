It's been a while since an update on here! Humblebrag - I've been too busy...

Since July I've been working fairly flat out on Web Development projects and even a few lighting projects. Bish Bash Buzz has taken a bit of a back seat as paid work takes priority.

[The Mermaid's Tongue](https://www.themermaidstongue.com) by [Swamp Motel](http://www.swampmotel.com) has been my main focus. I've been building and supporting their new online experience platform. It's a brilliant example of a live experience company having to adapt to a world without proper audiences!

I built (am am still improving) a new platform as an upgrade to their existing Zoom-based system. The goal was to increase the number of simultaneous games that could be played for a given amount of staff and equipment. I can't go into too much detail as it's an ongoing project but I can say we certainly smashed all the previous limitations on numbers and ease of scaling.

I've also been working on some *Lighting* projects! The biggest one has been a welcome return to my role as programmer at The Shard for their seasonal lighting display and also, as an extra special treat this year, as part of the New Year's Eve lighting and firework show across London. It was a privilidge to be a part of something like that. John Coman of [Woodroffe Bassett Design](https://www.woodroffebassett.com) had designed and programmed the pre-vis show, and I worked with him to integrate that into the lighting system and make adjustments once we saw how it looked in real life.

Here's hoping for a brief pause at some point so I can do some proper write ups of some of the interesting things I've built over the last year!
